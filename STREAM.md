# Stream
Stuff that's stream related.

Find the stream [over here on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/livecodingwithsch3lp).

## TODOs

* [ ] Maybe rename Stub to Fake
* [ ] Also save the date at which a Quote was posted
* [ ] And make sure they're ordered newest first

## Quotes

> Jonesuuu: When I kotlin, I kotlin. When I java, I java. But when I javascript.. I die a little on the inside.

## Improvements for next time
### Before
* [ ] Figure out royalty-free music again
* [ ] Set up the Just Chatting scene
* [ ] Set up a bot again to react to !socials, !discord, etc.
* [ ] Set up a bot again to block/ban spammers
* [ ] Do I want to save a local copy again to post to YouTube?
* [ ] Make github repo public + add README.md and LICENSE

### Just Before/During
* [ ] Configure StreamLabs' category to Creative 
* [ ] Make sure to talk in the mic in one direction
* [ ] Let the dog inside before starting the stream
