# Stream
Stuff that's stream related.

Find the stream [over here on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/livecodingwithsch3lp).

## TODOs

* [x] Also save the date at which a Quote was posted
* [x] Rename Either to Result/Ok/Error
* [x] Maybe rename Stub to Fake
* [x] And make sure they're ordered newest first
* [ ] Make sharing quotes work
* [ ] Format localdatetime output in json properly (like so: "2024-05-07T21:53:00Z" and not "[2024,05,07,21,53,00]")

## Quotes

> Jonesuuu: When I kotlin, I kotlin. When I java, I java. But when I javascript.. I die a little on the inside.
> karel1980: "I don't like component scanning" should be the first quote you put in the system when it's live

 
## Improvements for next time
### Before
